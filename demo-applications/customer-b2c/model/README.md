# Instructions for importing the correct Customer B2C Demo model

When you are prompted to import the model, choose the model XML file in the
Model folder:

*xdm-tutorials/demo-applications/customer-b2c/model/*

The model in the Model folder will always be the most up-to-date version.

If you are using an older version of xDM, you may need an older version of
the model for compatibility. Find all older model versions in the
demo-model-archive folder:

*xdm-tutorials/demo-applications/customer-b2c/model/demo-model-archive/*
